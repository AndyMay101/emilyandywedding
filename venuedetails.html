        <p>Dear We're getting married at Hargate Hall, a large old victorian house in the beautiful peak district.</p>
        <p>As our favourite people in the world we very much hope you can join us.  This won't be a particularly formal wedding and we're really just looking for an excuse for a big celebration and party. So in that vein we can promise free flowing food and booze, music, disco dancing and games in the garden.<p>
