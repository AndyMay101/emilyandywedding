        <p class="pbody">We're getting married at Hargate Hall <a class="pbody" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hargate+Hall/@53.2725812,-1.8253857,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487a2e193db90d09:0x4cc4f7824dfaa39c!8m2!3d53.272578!4d-1.823197" target="_blank">(SK17 8TA)</a>, a large old victorian house in the beautiful peak district.</p>
        <p class="pbody">As our favourite people in the world we very much hope you can join us. Join us for booze, music, disco dancing and games in the garden.</p>
        <p class="pbody"><strong>Friday 15 June. 7.00pm - onwards.</strong> Guests welcome at Hargate Hall for pre wedding drinks, party prep and games.</p>
        <p class="pbody"><strong>Saturday 16 June</strong> from 1pm, Wedding reception, ceremony (2pm), BBQ, fizz and disco dancing.</p>
        <p class="pbody"><strong>Sunday 17 June</strong> Optional walk in the Peak District (boots advised) and a pub lunch.</p>
        <p class="pbody"><strong>Car Parking:</strong> There is space for 45 cars at the hall, but parking is very tight. Any guests who arrive on Friday and do not need their car until Sunday can park at the back of the building and you can park around 10 cars there. Cars need to be parked closely together side by side, rather than nose to tail. Once the car park is full you’ll need to park on the far side of the main road on the verge. And we have a pizza van arriving on Saturday so there needs to be space for them to get through.</p>
<p class="pbody">The owner's son, William, will be on hand to help organise the parking. So please park where he tells you to!</p>
<p class="pbody"><strong>Friday night food:</strong> We will be putting on some food on Friday night but don’t expect a full meal - best to have a snack beforehand! Every apartment at the house has a kitchen, so you can always cook up something if you need anything extra.</p>
<p class="pbody"><strong>Transport/Taxis on Saturday night:</strong> The venue is in the middle of the countryside so we are providing transport on Saturday from 10pm-12.30am to Tideswell/Buxton for £10 per car/£2.50 per person to cover costs.</p>
<p class="pbody">The music isn’t turning off at 12.30am, so if you want to leave later than that there are a number of taxis in the area. It’s best to try and book ahead on the night but you can decide on the day. A 1am taxi is about £30-40 to Tideswell or Buxton & they run all night.</p>

  <p class="pbody"><strong>Sunday pub lunch:</strong> We'll be  walking from Hargate Hall to The George Inn in Tideswell for a roast dinner at 2pm. If you would like to join for the walk and/or the pub lunch you are most welcome! Click here if you want to pre-order the roast beef for £10 (veggie option possible), as we need to give numbers to the pub. If you don't fancy walking there will be some cars that can give you a lift! We’ll collect the £10 on Friday night so please bring cash.</p>
